# Sales-Analysis


## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Sales data of Electronic outlet. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Project Steps

### 1. Preview
  - **Tools Used**- Jupyter Notebook, Python, MYSQL Workbench
  - **Goal**- To Create a structured workspace in Jupyter Notebook for smooth data handling.

### 2. Set up Dataset
  - **Data Source**- Using Open source Kaggle to Download the readymade available dataset.
  - **Storage**- Save data in project file to access it in Jupyter notebook.

### 3. Explore Data
- **Loading Data**- Read the data into a Pandas FataFrame for initial analysis and transformation using Pandas Function.
- **Analysis**- Use functions like `.head()`,`.info()` and `.describe()` to get a quick overview of dataset.
- **Chech Volume**- use function `.shape()` to check the volume of set.

### 4. Data Cleaning
  - **Remove Dupplicates**- Identify and remove the duplicate entries to avoid uneven result.
  - **Handle Missing Values**- Drop rows and columns with missing values to avoid errors in result.
  - **Fix Data Types**- Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
  - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 5. Load Data into `.csv` format and into MYSQL
  - **To CSV File**- Save the cleaned file into `.csv` format for any further use.
  - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
  - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in both MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.

### 6. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
  - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
    - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
    - What city has the highest sales?
    - What time should we display advertisements to maximize likehood of customers buying products?
    - What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
